# 4 weeks 4 projects: React Challenge

Welcome to the 4 Weeks 4 Projects: React Challenge! 

This intensive program is designed to sharpen my React skills through hands-on projects. Over the course of four weeks, I will build four distinct applications, each focusing on different aspects of React development.

## Week 1: Movies with TMDB API

Welcome to the Global Movie Search project! This application is built using React and leverages the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to allow users to search for movies from around the world. Discover details about your favorite films, explore new releases, and find hidden gems with ease.

## Week 2: Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the Personal Portfolio project! This repository provides a beautifully styled and highly customizable portfolio template that allows users to create their own personal portfolio website. 
With easy-to-modify SVGs and images, you can make this portfolio truly yours with minimal effort.
